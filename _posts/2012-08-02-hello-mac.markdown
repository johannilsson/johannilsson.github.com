title: Hello Mac
---

After many years with Ubuntu and four years with my Dell I decided
to get myself a new computer, a MacBook Air 13'.

I can't really say why I decided to change to a Mac more than I wanted
to test it for real. I've heard of many people changing away from Linux
distributions to Mac because they want "something that just works" but the
last years that has not really been an issue, Ubuntu has been very
stable on my Dell and I even like Unity.

I choosed the 13' over the retina based 15' mainly because of the size. I
want a computer that's easy to cary and travel with.

I expected the switch to Mac OS to be a bit more complicated but so far
the transition has been pretty straight forward. After all this is
mostly how me screen looks like and a browser on the other desktop.

Getting environments up and running has been quite smooth. The upgrade to
Mountain Lion breaked and removed some things which was a bit unexpected though.
For extra packages I decided to go with MacPorts, this decision was only
based on recommendation and I did not digg in to the difference of the
alternatives but I'm happy with it so far. For terminal I switch between
the default and iTerm2.

My editor of choice is Vim which is the same. Previously I've more or
less just used the NERDTree plugin and some decent theme together with
vim-common. But for this setup I decided to try
[Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus/) to get up and running quickly.
Janus also added some new features that I slowly adpating and learning
now, seems like a nice package that I can recommend. I mainly use the arrow
keys for navigation in Vim but they randomly stopped working after the upgrade
to Mountain Lion (maybe related to switching between different desktops) but
after some Internet searching I found that adding `TERM=linux` to my
`.bashrc` solved that issue.

The biggest transition for me has been with the keyboard. I did not really
understand until now how much I actually use the `home` and `end` keys.
This has forced me to learn some new shortcuts in vim which I previously
did not needed to know of. The other keyboard issue has been the switch
from a Swedish layout to a U.S. layout, the Swedish layout requires some
very unnatural gestures for programming activities in Mac OS.

I'm not so happy with the Finder application though, the lack of tab
support annoys me and the mapping of enter to rename freaks me out.

But overall I'm happy with the switch, my biggest fear now is that Mac
OS will be to much of a lock in and turned into something like iOS.

Bye bye my old Dell, I'll miss you. XOXO

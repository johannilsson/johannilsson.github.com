title: Why Ads In STHLM Traveling?
---

[Google App Engine](http://www.google.com/enterprise/cloud/appengine/) is a cloud service that deals with a lot of usually hard things to cope with like automatic scaling during high load, easy deploy and a lot of other things I've come to like. I've used App Engine as a backend for [STHLM Traveling](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.markupartist.sthlmtraveling) since 2009, always knowing that it has been in beta and things can and most likely will change. The App Engine team have also announced that their price model will change when they leave beta.

App Engine left beta a few days ago, but no one had guesed that the price will increase by this much. For STHLM Traveling this means that the **monthly cost will increase from $0.5 to approximate $150**. I develop STHLM Traveling in my spare time and previous cost has been covered by my self and with donations, thank you all that have been donating!

To try to cover some of the new costs I've added ads on a few spots in the app. Hopefully they will not hide any functionality and be in the way for any use case. They might even show some interesting things to read while commuting, who knows?

The plan is to have the ads for a period to see how much of the hosting costs can be covered and then evaluate what the next step will be. I've also started the work to migrate away from App Engine to reduce the cost. During this period some of the functionality in the app may have to be disabled depending on how long it takes to migrate to a new platform.

Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any question on this or other things on the app. I have many new things planned for the app and the app is still [open source](https://github.com/johannilsson/sthlmtraveling) but the next thing on the agenda is the migration away from App Engine.

Thank you for your patience and I hope you will understand why I needed to do this change.

## Update

I realized that just adding ads without an alternative was not a good way to do this. The latest version on Android Market has the ads disabled, the way forward is to focus on rebuilding and migrating the server.

During this time I hope that the cost will be covered by donations. I accept donations using Pledgie or Flattr. If you or anyone you know want to sponsor the costs please don't hesitate to contact me. If you donate and I still decide to introduce a paid version I promise that you will get that app for free.

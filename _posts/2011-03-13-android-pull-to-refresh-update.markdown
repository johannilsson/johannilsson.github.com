title: Android Pull To Refresh Update

<img src="/images/android-pull-to-refresh.png" alt="Android Pull To Refresh screenshots" width="550">

Today I pushed a few changes to the [Android Pull To Refresh](https://github.com/johannilsson/android-pulltorefresh) project that actually makes it possible to use it in a project.

There's still work to do and I wouldn't call it stable, but please test it and let me know how it runs. There's an example project distributed with the source and examples in the README that should get one up and running fairly quick.

I'm very greatful for the high quality contributions I've got so far, thank you [Eddie Ringle](https://github.com/eddieringle), [Jason Knight](https://github.com/synthable), [mattg1981](https://github.com/mattg1981) and [MantaMay](https://github.com/MantaMay).
